# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by focusing on people's goals rather than the user's preferences. I implement the user's needs into a program by the customers input throughout the process of developing. I also implement the user needs by using the product backlog as setting development priorities. We would have daily meetings with the whole team to communicate the user's needs and list them by importance. User stories help the development team by giving back a perspecitve from the user. This tool help create a description of a requirement. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I would approach developing programs by changing the requirements when necessary by communicating with my team. I would incorporate face-to-face communication for future development work so that the team can be more effective and afficent when communicating over development needs. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member for software development is more goal-oriented istead of self-oriented.
